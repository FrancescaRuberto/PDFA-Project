### Introduction
This project analyses the age dynamics of the Irish population concentrating on the historical trends of the Irish people while estimating the changes for the years 2025 and 2030. It investigates crucial details of the overall population data, such as age distribution, gender structure, development of the mean age, and measures of variation â€“ standard deviation between and within the age cohorts. It also offers estimates of the Irish population, or what these trends imply, in an effort to elaborate the dynamics further into the future.

The rationale for undertaking this project is based on the recent realization of the significance of the demographic dynamics with respect to the issues of the day. Policy making, addressing social problems, as well as the health care, education, and infrastructure development sectors, all rely on demographic data. Therefore, by examining these trends, the goal of this project is to provide critical information that would be useful in promoting proactive planning.

### Methodology 

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
Populations were split into gender and age categories to see how equitable the distribution was.
Calculated key metrics like mean age and standard deviation for the various groups.

- **Projection Models**: 
The linear regression model was leveraged to estimate 2025 and 2030-values for each age band in the population. 

- **Visualization**: 
Generated visual representations including bar charts and line charts which describe population distribution, gender share and the anticipated trends in population dynamics with changes.

### Key Findings

- **Demographic Distribution**: The current structure of the population portrays a bulk of youth with a gradually decreasing base as the age increases, showing a decrease of numbers among the older section of the population.

- **Gender Balance**: In older age groups, women greatly outnumber men due to higher life expectancy, while the number of males suffers significantly from greater declines as the age increases.

- **Mean Age**: The economy is in transition as there is a gradual replacement of younger age groups by older ones among the population and in such circumstances the number or average age rate of increase will always be there.

- **Standard Deviation: The pattern of age group for each year has remained without great fluctu**ations except for slight variations between the years analysed.

- **Demographic Projection**: The trend of aging will continue for bigger share of older people in the population most likely the healthcare systems and sustainable growth of the economy will be challenged with this shift.

### Acknowledgments

This project relies on data provided by the [Central Statistics Office](https://data.cso.ie/). Their commitment to transparency and accessibility in statistical data collection was instrumental in enabling this analysis.

## Analysis of the Age Group Distribution

### Introduction 
The analysis of age group distribution provides a comprehensive understanding of the population structure by categorization individuals into predefined age brackets. This segmentation is essential for identifying demographic trends, supporting targeted strategies, and aiding in resources allocation. 

Additionally, a detailed breakdown by year and gender allows for the identification of temportal trends and patterns. Scatter plots are employed to visually explore relationships and trends in the dataset. 

### Methodology 
Age Group Distribution Analysis:
- The dataset was grouped by age groups (e.g. 0-14, 15-24, 25-34, etc.).
- Total population counts were calculated for each gorup, further disaggregated by gender. 
- Stacked bar charts were generated to display the gender proportions within each age group. 

Detailed Breakdown by Year and Gender:
- The population was further analyzed by year to observe trends in age and gender distribution over time. 
- Scatter plots were used to visualize changes, plotting population counts for each gender-age group-year combination. 
- Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) facilitated the data aggregation and visualization. 

### Findings
Population Structure:
- Bulk of youth: The largest population share resides in younger age groups, particularly 15-24 and 25-34.
- Declining 0-14 group: A clear downward trend is observed in the youngest age group, reflecting reduced birth rates or family size over the analyzed years.
- Decreasing older population: The 60+ group shows a significant drop, consistent with aging trends and potentially lower life expectancy.

Yearly and Gender Trends:
- 0-14 Trend: Scatter plots illustrate a steady decline over time in this group for both genders, pointing to demographic shifts.
- Gender Stability: Most age groups show balanced gender distributions, with only minor deviations.

### Insights
- Youth Bulk and Strategic Implications:
The predominance of younger age groups highlights opportunities for policies targeting education, employment, and skill development.
However, the declining 0-14 group suggests the need for family support policies to counteract falling birth rates.
- Aging Trends:
The reduction in older populations underlines potential healthcare challenges and the need for investments in elder care.
- Visualizing Temporal Trends:
The combination of bar charts and scatter plots effectively illustrates both the bulk of youth and the decreasing population base in older groups.
- Future Considerations:
If the declining 0-14 trend persists, challenges related to a shrinking workforce and dependency ratios could emerge in the coming decades.

## Gender Balance Analysis

### General Concept of Male-to-Female Ratio
Male-to-female ratio is one of the important index of demographic researches, which can be used to measure the gender balance. It is defined as a ratio of the number of males to the number of females in a chosen category. This ratio is applicable to many different data subsets such as age (categories), geographical regions or time (period).

Purpose: To pinpoint gender imbalances in particular demographics.

Applications: Healthcare planning, social policy formulation, and analyzing societal trends.

### Introduction
This section examines the Male-to-Female Ratio across various age groups in Ireland between 2020 and 2024. he Male-to-Female Ratio is a key demographic indicator that highlights the gender distribution within populations. It helps pinpoint specific groups or time periods where one gender is more prevalent, shedding light on social and biological trends.

The ratio is calculated as:

[![male-to-female-ratio.png](https://i.postimg.cc/h45n5JNs/male-to-female-ratio.png)](https://postimg.cc/YjYT4SrL)
 
- If >1: More males than females.
- If <1: More females than males.
- If =1: Equal numbers of males and females.


Understanding these patterns helps policymakers and researchers address gender-specific needs and plan resources effectively.

### Methodology

- **Data Preparation**:
The dataset's "Age Group" column contained duplicate items, like "Year," which were removed along with any extraneous information in the brackets to standardise the age brackets. They were divided into groups based on age, sex, and year, and the total population was calculated.

- **Ratio Calculation**:
Males were displayed on one side of the pivot table, while female population counts for each year were plotted on the other side to help differentiate the male population from the female population. The percentage of the male population compared to the female population was used to calculate the male-to-female ratio.

- **Visualization**:
The age group male to female ratio was depicted using a horizontal bar chart in which age group rank was ordered from youngest to oldest for easy shifting of h group. For data analysis and visualization, Python libraries namely Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, were employed.

### Findings

- **Youth Population (0-14 years)**: For younger age groups, such as 0-14 years, the Male-to-Female Ratio is slightly above 1. For example:
In 2020, the ratio for this age group was 1.05, indicating 5% more males than females.
Similar patterns were observed in 2021 and 2022.

- **Middle Age Groups (15-64 years)**: Ratios are closer to 1 in middle age groups, suggesting a more balanced gender distribution. Minor variations are observed across years.

- **Older Population (70+ years)**: The ratio declines significantly for older age groups, reflecting a higher proportion of females due to longer female life expectancy. For example:
In 2022, the ratio was 0.92 for the 75-79 age group, indicating 8% fewer males than females.

### Insights

- **Observations on Gender Disparities Across Age Groups**: For younger population groups a slight male majority is detcted, which aligns with biological trends at birth (slightly more males are born than females).
While older populations reflect the higher female life expectancy, leading to a female-dominated demographic in older age brackets.

- **Patterns over time**: The Male-to-Female Ratio remains consistent across the analyzed years, showing no major fluctuations or unexpected changes.

- **Policy Implications**: The analysis shows a clear impact on social policies. Especially in the healthcare sector, the higher proportion of females in older age groups indicates a need for elderly care services tailored to women.
While, concerning youth development, the slight male dominance in younger populations suggests opportunities to analyze gender-specific needs in education and development.

- **Visualization Benefits**: The utilization of horizontal bar charts helps in identifying and underlining gender disparities at a glance, as the scale clearly highlights differences in the ratio for each age group.

## Analysis of the Evolution of Mean Age (Aging Trend)

### Introduction
This section aims to explore the evolution of the mean age of Irelandâ€™s population from 2020 to 2024. Understanding changes in the age structure of a population is crucial for policymakers, especially when planning for healthcare, social services, and workforce strategies. By calculating the weighted mean age of various age groups, we can gain insights into the aging trends and demographic shifts in Ireland over this period. This analysis helps provide a more accurate representation of how the population's average age has changed in response to various factors such as fertility rates, life expectancy, and migration.

### Methodology
To calculate the weighted mean age of Irelandâ€™s population, we started by assigning a central value to each age group, which represents the midpoint of the age range. For example:

- 0-4 years: 2 years
- 5-9 years: 7 years
- 65-69 years: 67 years
- 85+ years: 87 years (the central value for this age group)

Once the central age values were assigned to each age group, we calculated the weighted mean age for each year using the following formula:

[![mean-age-formula.png](https://i.postimg.cc/LXzwwbZw/mean-age-formula.png)](https://postimg.cc/vgZ06Xht)

Where:

Population of Age Group is the population count for a specific age group in a given year.
Central Age of Age Group is the representative central value (midpoint) for that age group.
This method allows us to get a more accurate measure of the mean age by accounting for the size of each age group. The central age values were mapped to the age groups, and the weighted mean age was computed by multiplying these central values by the corresponding population counts for each age group. The sum of these weighted values was then divided by the total population of all age groups for that year.

The results were then visualized in a line chart, where the x-axis represents the year (2020-2024), and the y-axis represents the weighted mean age. This visualization helps track how the mean age evolves over time and highlights any trends or shifts in the population's age structure.

### Findings

The results reveal a gradual increase in the weighted mean age of Irelandâ€™s population over the five-year period. As I analyzed the data, it became evident that certain age groups, especially the older ones, are contributing more to the population's aging trend. The weighted mean age, which considers both the central age values and the population sizes of each group, shows a steady rise, indicating that the population is indeed becoming older.

### Insights

The findings suggest a significant shift in the age structure of the population, with potential implications for public policy. An aging population could lead to increased demand for healthcare services, retirement benefits, and social care programs. It could also have an impact on the labor market, with a potentially shrinking workforce in the coming years. This trend highlights the importance of preparing for the challenges posed by an older demographic and adapting policies to support an aging population, such as increasing pension provision and improving healthcare accessibility.

Additionally, the data may serve as a foundation for further demographic studies, helping to track how factors like immigration, birth rates, and life expectancy influence the age profile of the population over the next decades.

## Standard Deviation

### Introduction

The standard deviation is a statistical measure used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data points. It is a vital metric to understand how spread out the values in a data set are relative to the mean (average) of the data. In the context of population analysis, the standard deviation helps to determine how much individual age groups deviate from the average age of the population.

By calculating the standard deviation for the age group centers, we gain insight into how diverse the age distribution is. If the standard deviation is high, it suggests a larger diversity in age groups. Conversely, a low standard deviation indicates that the age distribution is more concentrated around the average age.

### Methodology

Age Group Centers: The central value of each age group, or the age group center, is calculated as the midpoint of the age range for each group. For example, for the group "0-4 years," the center would be 2, while for the group "85+ years," the center would be considered as 87 (or the average age of this group).

Standard Deviation Calculation:

The standard deviation is calculated using NumPyâ€™s np.std() function, which computes the square root of the variance.


The formula for standard deviation is:

[![sd-formula.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pXXHMPKc/sd-formula.png)](https://postimg.cc/K4VVnSqt)


- \( x_i \) represents each individual age group center.
- \( \mu \) is the mean (average) of the age group centers.
- \( n \) is the number of age groups.


Calculation:
The standard deviation of the age group centers is calculated from the following values (the centers of the age groups):

[7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67, 72, 77, 82, 87]

These values represent the midpoint of each age group, ranging from the youngest group (0-4 years) to the oldest group (85+ years). We apply the standard deviation formula using these values to calculate the degree of variation.

### Findings
Mean Calculation: The mean of the age group centers will be the central point around which the age groups are distributed. The range of the centers is from 7 to 87, indicating a broad spread across age groups.
Standard Deviation: The calculated standard deviation reflects the amount of variation present. Given that the age group centers span a wide range, the standard deviation will be moderately high, indicating considerable dispersion in the population's age structure.

### Insights

- **Dispersion of Data**: 
A higher standard deviation indicates that the age groups are spread out over a wider range, showing greater diversity in the population's age distribution.
A low standard deviation would indicate that most age groups are closely grouped around the mean age, suggesting a less diverse population.

- **Demographic Diversity**:
The relatively high standard deviation in this case suggests that there is a significant diversity in age groups, with a notable presence of older age groups (85+ years), which contributes to the variation in the population.

- **Comparison Over Time or Categories**:
By examining the standard deviation over time (e.g., comparing different years or periods), we can track how the age distribution of the population has shifted. For example, an increase in the standard deviation could indicate a growing diversity in age groups, possibly due to an aging population.

- **Anomalies or Outliers**:
A very high standard deviation might suggest the presence of outliers or extreme age groups (such as a very high concentration of elderly individuals). These outliers might need further investigation to understand their impact on the overall population distribution.
